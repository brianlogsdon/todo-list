 # Todo List

A todo list app that you can add and delete items from.
## What I learned
Create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks.

Requirements:

* Your app needs to look like [this](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=todo-list&preview).
* The tasks are added when the user press enter on the keyboard.
* The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.
* The user can add as many tasks as they want..
* With React: A standard react application, data is stored inside the component state.
